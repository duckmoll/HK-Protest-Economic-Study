        I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in New York University majoring in mathematics and economics, and I am currently
        studying Data Science in Georgetown University. I always felt interested about technology and finance. After I
        graduated from NYU, I worked at two fintech companies, M Science and Balyasny Asset Management, as data
        scientist. M Science is a data-driven investment research firm, and Balyasny is a hedge fund. In the former
        company, I developed data science product Swipe Europe from TB size of unstructured data to deliver actionable
        insight to investment clients. After I made move to the investment side, I was able to leverage my data research
        capability obtained from M Science to develop quantitative trading strategies using different proprietary
        datasets.

        The motivation for building this data project is that Hong Kong after the social unrest event in 2020 deserves
        additional study about its economy. In a globalized world powered by internet, people have more options of where
        to allocate their assets. One of the great advantages of data is to help people make informed decisions. I want
        to use this study to explore the possible long-term routes of Hong Kong economy. Incorporating data analytics
        with economic statistics can provide a comprehensive and timely analysis.
