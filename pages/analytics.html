      <h2>Historical Economy Before the Protest</h2>
      <p>
        Having a historical perspective is important. It helps one to understand the cause of major economic events,
        and their long-run impacts. This section gives a timeline of key economic events in
        Hong Kong’s history.
      </p>
      <p>
        For much of its history, Hong Kong’s main economic function was as mainland
        China’s entrepôt. After World War II, rapid industrialization through industrial transplantation
        and relocation from mainland China turned Hong Kong into a manufacturing and export center
        such as textiles. As Britain re-established civil government in 1946, Hong Kong built its
        market system inherited from the UK, which absorbed Hong Kong as part of the global alliance dominated
        by UK and US. Since then, Hong Kong started to play an important role in Asia economy as a British outpost.
      </p>

      <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Figure1: Old Hong Kong Port</figcaption>
      <p>
        In 1970s, Hong Kong was established as one of the “Asian Dragons” together with South Korea, Singapore, and
        Taiwan,
        which underwent rapid industrialization and maintained exceptionally high growth rates. After China
        economic reform in 1978, a huge market was opened to the global financial market. With the relocation
        of manufacturing to China’s Pearl River Delta, Hong Kong’s focus shifted from industrial to service economy,
        including financial service and professional service. Since financial service is an exceptionally large
        part of Hong Kong economy, it is separated from other services. Other professional services cover legal,
        accounting, auditing, scientific research, management consulting, etc. When China was trying to adopt to
        the global economy, Hong Kong already had extensive expertise and could provide valuable services to
        both international and mainland businesses. As the bridge between mainland and the world, Hong Kong
        benefited much from its service-oriented model. After handover to China in
        1997, Hong Kong returned to China and its economic tie with mainland continued to be strengthened.
        The tourism industry flourished along with its rapid growth, and had a sharp
        increase of domestic tourists from mainland China. Therefore in Hong Kong, four key industries primarily
        drive domestic economic growth: financial services, tourism, trading and Logistics, and professional and
        producer services. These are the weathervanes of the Hong Kong economy.

      <h2>Economic Effect</h2>
      <p>
        The Anti-Extradition Bill protest began with a sit-in at the government headquarters on 15 March 2019 and
        a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9 June 2019, followed by a gathering outside
        the Legislative Council Complex to stall the bill's second reading on 12 June. The protest peaked
        2 million participants in June 2019, according to the organizer, while the police estimated that there
        were 340,000 at its peak. Later in May 2020, the introduction of National Security Law drew another wave of
        strong reaction
        . But the number of protesters were much smaller than 2019. This section will only focus on the
        effect of the first and largest wave protest from March to August 2019.

      <p>
        Although modern economists and statisticians have provided a set of tools like GDP, employment rate,
        to understand the economy in a quantitative manner, people tend to use them from a statistics perspective
        like quoting the numerical values in an article, or only use one or few charts to corroborate their arguments.
        One big reasons is paper media is not flexible. With the development of web technologies,
        people not only can see the charts, but can also interact with it, and form their own opinions
        from the data. Paper media is only good at giving one point of view, a one-dimensional world. This
        section aims to provide a multi-dimensional data-dashboard experience to include as many relevant
        data visualizations as possible to explore the economic effect of Hong Kong 2019-2020 protest.

      <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Figure4: Population</figcaption>
      <p>
        Hong Kong can be geographically divided into three territories: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and
        New Territories. There are approximately 7 Million population in Hong Kong and half of them live
        in the New Territories. Population has been stable for the past six years.
      </p>
      <h5>Transportaion</h5>
      <p>
        Hong Kong has a highly developed and diverse transport network. Based on Hong Kong Government's Travel
        Characteristics Survey, over 90% of the daily journeys are on public transport,
        the highest rate in the world. Therefore, the transportation data is a good indication
        of Hong Kongers' outdoor activities.

      <p>
        From the monthly year-over-year table, total public transport started to decline at a rate of 0.74% in
        July 2019, and peaked at 19.38% in November. Among ways of transportation, Airport Express Line
        was affected the most.

        All retail outlets declined since Feb 2019, and declined the most at Oct 2019. “Fruits and vegetable,
        fresh” category kept a strong growth rate since 2019, “Jewellery, watches, and valuable gifts” declined
        the most in 2019.

      <h5>Employment</h5>
      <p>
        Employment is linked to economic growth in many ways. The stability of the economy rests on the ability to
        maintain a low unemployment rate, while high unemployment often leads to high crime rate. Work also
        directly contributes to economic growth: high employment means a greater number of goods can be produced,
        and workers can receive money to spend on buying the goods been produced.

      <p>
        The overall employment slightly declined at the end of 2018, and gradually worsened since May 2019. One thing to
        note is that even though Manufacture declined the most during 2019 Q2, but the decline started long before
        the protest. On a month over month basis(horizontally), most industries colors slowly change from
        “blue”
        to “orange”. “Accommodation food services” and “Retail” suffered the most since 2019. Comparing to consumer
        spending and transportation, employment has a less drastic change in response to the protest. The change comes
        in a more slow and long-term manner.

        The most comprehensive measure of overall economic performance is gross domestic product or GDP. The traditional
        Four Key Industries in Hong Kong, including financial services, tourism, trading and logistics, and professional
        and producer services contribute 20%, 20% , 12%, 5% to
        overall GPD respectively, providing impetus to growth of other sectors and creating employment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hong Kong’s GDP per capita suffered a retraction of -0.09% in 2019. While seemingly insignificant, this was the
        third time Hong Kong’s economy failed to grow in over 50 years. The previous two times were 1998 Asian Financial
        Crisis, and 2008 Global Financial Crisis.

        While overall professional and producer services declined overall starting 2019 Q3 (-5.26%), it experienced
        mixed
        effects among different categories. “Real Estate” and “Professional, scientific, and technical services” were
        relatively unhampered, managing to grow from 2018 to 2019. “Tourism, convention, and exhibition services”
        declined by a steep 27.45%.
      </p>
      <p>
        On an aggregate level, protest caused the economic retraction in the second half of 2019. Tourism and trading
        and logistic suffered 22.7% and 4.1% decline respectively.
        Financial Services and Professional Services showed relatively stronger resilience.

      <h2>Financial Market</h2>
      <p>Amid the protests, investor’s confidence in Hong Kong took a big hit. As the retail business was hampered by
        store closures and sharp decrease in tourists arrivals, investors concerned that a recession would be possible.
        Protesters’ hostility toward pro-extradition-bill companies also damaged the business image of Hong Kong. </p>

        The Hang Seng Index(HSI) is composed of the largest companies of the Hong Kong stock market and is the main
        indicator of the overall financial market performance. The stock started to decline since
        the protest started in May, and had another wave of selling off in July as the tension intensified.

      <p>As a top ranked international financial center, Hong Kong provides a conduit for China to raise financial
        capital, more specifically equity financing, as well as knowledge from the global capital market. Inherited from
        the British colonial era, Hong Kong’s financial system was built on the global capital system dominated by UK
        and US. Combining with its offshore jurisdiction status under the concept of “One Country, Two Systems”, Hong
        Kong has established an uniquely advantageous position in equity financing. However, the months-long protests
        over the new extradition bill had driven away investors and companies.</p>
      <p>Amid the turmoil, Reuters reported that Chinese giant Alibaba postponed its up to $15 billion listing. The Wall
        Street Journal reported Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant Saudi Aramco was said to switch its preference from Hong
        Kong or London to Tokyo as the international destination to list its shares.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong's role as a major source of foreign direct investment (FDI) and a major destination of outward direct
        investment (ODI) has been evolving. In 2018, the share of the FDI that has come from Hong Kong to invest in
        Mainland China over the total FDI Mainland China has attracted is over 50%. And majority of the inflow and
        outflow have been concentrated in investment, real estate and business services.
      </p>
      <p>Despite the negative trend caused by the social unrest in 2019, Hong Kong still ranked as the seventh
        most attractive destination in the world for FDI in 2019, and within developing Asia it was the second-largest
        recipient after China, followed by Singapore, India and Indonesia, according to UNCTAD.(UN Conference on Trade
        and Development)

      <h2>Online Sentiment</h2>
      <p>
        Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics,
        and many more to identify and quantify the sentiment of some kind of text or audio. This project uses
        unsupervised lexicon-based approach based on Vader lexicon for sentiment analysis. Here are the daily sentiment
        indexes based on news data from News IO, and comment data from Reddit.

      <p>
        News sentiment was negative between June 2019 and Feb 2020. Then it started to pick up fast since May
        2020 and peaked at June. Both protests follow the same timelines as the first and second wave of protest, but
        showed opposite
        reactions.

      <h2>Long Term Economic Effect</h2>
      <p>As shown from the above analysis, almost all the economic indicators took a hit at 2019 Q2.
        From the short-term perspective, the economy was certainly affected. </p>
      <p>It is still unclear how the protest will affect the economy in the long-term, since COVID-19 kick in soon after
        the protest, and is still present. It is challenging to attribute any changes in that period to a non-COVID
        event. On the other hand, figuring out the ongoing effect of the protest is valuable. It can provide insight
        for policy makers and investors to vision upcoming changes and make timely decisions.</p>
      <p>This section introduces a method to estimate the protest effect on economy when COVID-19 is still present.
        The idea is subtracting COVID-19 effect from GDP growth, and comparing the growth between countries.
        Since GDP and COVID-19 are two very different measures,
        simply subtract one from another does not provide any interpretation. This section will use the rank of GDP
        growth rate between countries and the rank of COVID-19 infection rate by population between countries.</p>
      <p>For example, if A,B,C are in a running race, we know A has a severe injury, B has a mild injury, and C has no
        injury. An intuitive approach to estimate the ranking in full-load, no injury condition is
        to subtract the severity of their injury from current rank.</p>
      <h5>Scenario 1</h5>
      <object type="text/html" data="../assets/analytics/scenario1.png" width="50%" , height="100px"></object>
      <figcaption style="text-align: left;">Table6: Example 1</figcaption>
      <p>Rank ex injury: A = B = C. Here C won the first place, but because they have better injury condition
        than A and B, their normal condition performance may just be the same.</p>
      <h5>Scenario 2</h5>
      <object type="text/html" data="../assets/analytics/scenario2.png" width="50%" , height="100px"></object>
      <figcaption style="text-align: left;">Table7: Example 2</figcaption>
      <p>Rank ex injury: B > A > C. Here B won the first place with mild injury. They certainly outpace C in no-injury
        condition, and may also outpace A.</p>
      <p>
        Applying the same method to GDP growth rate and COVID-19 infection rate. Running race is replaced by GDP
        growth, and injury is replaced by COVID-19. Below are the rankings between China, US, UK, Hong Kong, France,
        Japan, and Singapore.

      <h5>2020 GDP ex COVID Rank Estimation</h5>

      <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Table9: 2020 GDP Rank - COVID Rank Estimation</figcaption>
      <p>So the GDP growth ranking of 2020 excluding COVID effect is US > Singapore > China = UK > France = Japan > Hong
        Kong.</p>
      <h5>GDP Rank Comparison</h5>
      <img class="featured-image img-fluid" src="../assets/analytics/gdp_rank_compare.png" alt="" width="90%"
        height="100%">
      <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Table10: GDP Rank Compare</figcaption>
      <p>Hong Kong’s GDP is ranked the 7th after removing COVID-19 effect. It is the first time it
        falls to the last place. It means</p>
      <blockquote style='color:#6A041D;border-left: 4px solid #6A041D;'>Even though Hong Kong was not impacted much by
        COVID-19 compared to other countries, GDP
        still performed poorly.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Same method can be applied to 2021's GDP data. Whether 2019 is a major turning point for Hong Kong economy,
        2021’s data is important to look
        into.</p>
      <p>It is still unclear what the long-term impact of the protest will be. On the bright side, Hong Kong has been
        and still is an important international trade port, and it likely will be in the future. From the financial
        service and FDI data, Hong Kong remains an attractive destination for investment and businesses. It has a unique
        role in Asia financial market. The future is yet to come.</p>
